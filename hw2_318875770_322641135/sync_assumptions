# Ido's assumptoins
- Global array of mutexes - one for each file, in the index as the file. Named file_counters_mutexes.
- MAX_COMMANDS_IN_JOB macro defuned in macros.h as maximum commands in a job
- Global mutex of shared queque jobs named mutex_of_shared_jobs_queque 
- pthread condition - available jobs in shared jobs queue. Named ava_jobs_cond

# Noa's assumptoins
- MAX_WORKER_THREADS macro define max number of worker thread to create
- MAX_COUNTER_FILES macro define max number of counter files to create
- convention: If all workes fine, closing the cmd_file in the dispatcher main function called dispatcher().
- JobQueue looks like: 
        typedef struct JobQueue {
            Job* head;
            Job* tail;
            int size;
            int active_jobs;           // The counter for pending/running worker tasks
            pthread_mutex_t lock;      // Mutex to protect access to the queue and counter
            pthread_cond_t cond_idle;  // Condition variable to wake the dispatcher
        } JobQueue;

- pop_job() - returns pointer to job_cmds -> after pop it needs to be freed
