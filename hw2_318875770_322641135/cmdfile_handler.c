// TODO: Implement commands from command files "cmd_file_executor".
    // Should read commands from each line of the command file, dispatcher  commands should be executed 
    // sequentially.
    // Commands starting with worker should be assigned to shared work queue (to be executed by worker threads
    // when available).
